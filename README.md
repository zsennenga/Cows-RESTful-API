Cows-RESTful-API
================

A RESTful api used to interact with the UC Davis COmmunity Web Scheduler

This is intended to replace Cows-TV-Server, Cows-Tablet-Server and Cows-Mobile-Server with a single, more unified API.

This will also remove the need for a user to handle auth/deauth to COWS, or maintain the TGC beyond using it
to generate an initial API key.
